We conducted a comprehensive study of trajectory optimization algorithms for All-Electric Aircraft (AEA).

For AEA, battery charge minimization can serve as a potential objective function since the battery pack is the sole power resource for the aircraft. Trajectory optimization directly affects range capabilities, which is a main challenge for AEA due to their very limited storage capacities resulting from current battery technologies. It is necessary to integrate battery dynamics and flight dynamics when formulating and solving the energy management problem for AEA.
