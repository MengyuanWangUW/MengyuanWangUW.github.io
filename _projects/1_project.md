For Hybrid-Electric Aircraft, it is generally assumed that the gas turbine and electric motor are connected mechanically, allowing the gas turbine to charge the battery during flight. The potential benefits includes: (a)The engine can run in its most efficient region to conserve fuel by using the electric motor as an extra load; (b)The electric motor can work in "one-engine-inoperative" (OEI) mode by charging the battery to its fully charged state after the climbing phase. These benefits are suitable for series, parallel, and series-parallel configurations.

However, these benefits have never been testified theoretically nor experimentally.

We compare two parallel hybrid electric architectures-one with and one without mechanical connection between the engines and the electric motors-we apply the power allocation algorithm we proposed previously to the energy management for the propulsion system in a 19-seat conceptual Hybrid Electric Aircraft.
