We formulate the operating cost minimization as an optimal control problem. The battery dynamics and flight dynamics are combined together, and the OCP is examined in the context of Pontryaginâ€™s Minimum Principle
(PMP), providing necessary optimality conditions for the proposed integrated approach.
